Important que:
1)Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
NOTE : The path has to end on a leaf node.

2)Find the lowest common ancestor in an unordered binary tree given two values in the tree.
Lowest common ancestor : the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both
v and w as descendants.
