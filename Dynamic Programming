DP:
Enhanced Recursion(Recursion + storage)

How to know that this particular is DP problem :
optimal (find max , min)
given choice(have choice to choose elements)

APPROACH : 
There are two approaches topdown(iterative way store from top to bottom) & memosization(storage from last to top)
Write recursive soln

How to chck base consition:
Think for smallest valid input

Recursive function syntax:

Dimendion pf table depends upon variables which are hanging


TYPES OF QUESTION:
1)0/1 knapsack 
  How to identify:
   -An array is given
   -A no. is given(may be sum)
   -Find optmal                                          Types of knapsack problem                    
-Subset sum                                   1)Fractional knapsack:(Can be solved via greedy approcah)If complete item couldnot be accomodataed in knapsack , then you can put item in knapsack bh doing its fraction
-Equal sum partition                          2)0/1 knapsack:Either put it complete o don't put
-count of subset sum                          3)Unbounded knapsack:Multiple occurences of a single item
-minimum subset sum difference
-target sum
-minm no. of difference with given dufference
2)Unbounded knapsack
3)Fibonacci
4)LCS
5)LIS
6)Kadane's Algo
7)Matrix chain multiplicatoin(will study recursive solution)
-MCM(Input = array/string , will askoptimal)
Proedure: 
         Find i & j
